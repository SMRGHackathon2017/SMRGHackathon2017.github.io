### Ethics




We’re working on open data at this hackathon, and we love open data. However, we also need to recognise that we’re still at work as Civil Servants, and so need to reflect this in the way we handle this data, the analysis we carry out, and the way we talk about the findings. 

Strict ethical considerations have been adhered to at all times in order to ensure citizens privacy is protected. The aim is to identify themes and patterns in order to improve good government, not compromise trust or privacy. 

Please bear this in mind when performing analysis and data gathering. At no stage should individual details be stored beyond obtaining raw data or shared. Prior to the event, please read our guidance regarding ethical use of data.

- ONS guidance on webscraping.  You have received this on a recent email. Not online since its not published yet.

### Topics

There are three topics that we would like to explore. These have been proposed by colleagues from Department for Work and Pensions, Ministry of Justice and Cabinet Office as topics that would aid their research. A full write up of the projects is here in Dropbox, and summaries are below:


           
           
           Aim: 
           
           Gain insight into the types of jobs advertised and compare to existing official statistics
           Example areas for investigation: Types of jobs, Amounts, Where advertised and through whom, Skills etc
           
           Potential approaches: 
           
           Visualisation tool for jobcentre staff to be able to visualise types and areas advertised,
           Spatial analysis, Natural Language Processing. 
           
           For those who are less technical: 
           
           Comparisons to existing data sources, 
           research into prevalence of jobs being advertised on social media - can apply directly or are they 
           re-directed to job site?

### Careful with sharing!!!

We want to promote the exploration of social media research within government across the professions, however we ask that you treat these topics with the same discretion as you would if they were being researched within your own department. Thus please do not tweet about findings or share your findings externally. Please be careful when using visualisation tools that may share data/ analysis in an open way.
