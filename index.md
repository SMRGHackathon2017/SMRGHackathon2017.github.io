### Why a Hackathon?
<br><br>

The Social Media Research Group (SMRG) are running our first cross-government hackathon for civil servants who have an interest in social media research.This is a collaborative research event where attendees will have one day to use data-science techniques and technologies to explore given topic areas of justice, employment and public engagement with government issues.



<br><br>

### Ethics

<br><br>

We’re working on open data at this hackathon, and we love open data. However, we also need to recognise that we’re still at work as Civil Servants, and so need to reflect this in the way we handle this data, the analysis we carry out, and the way we talk about the findings. 

Strict ethical considerations have been adhered to at all times in order to ensure citizens privacy is protected. The aim is to identify themes and patterns in order to improve good government, not compromise trust or privacy. 

Please bear this in mind when performing analysis and data gathering. At no stage should individual details be stored beyond obtaining raw data or shared. Prior to the event, please read our guidance regarding ethical use of data.

- ONS guidance on webscraping.  You have received this on a recent email. Not online since its not published yet.Please do not share this more widely

- Please also see the Cabinet Office [Data Science Ethical Framework](https://data.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/164/2015/12/Data-science-ethics-short-for-blog-1.pdf)

### Topics
<br><br>
There are three topics that we would like to explore. These have been proposed by colleagues from Department 
for Work and Pensions,Ministry of Justice and Cabinet Office as topics that would aid their research. 
A full write up of the projects is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/93mmiijkf7xn2d0/Hackathon%20Topic%20Overviews.DOCX?dl=0), and summaries are below:


<br><br>

### Cabinet Office Strand: 
Public engagement with government – opinions and views on government activity
<br><br>

    # Aim: 
    
    Better understand dynamics and representativeness of comments 
    to guide analysis of public opinion
    
    # Example areas for investigation: 
    
    Intensity and plurality (How many people engaged)? 
    Is the conversation biased by certain groups?), 
    Gender and diversity, 
    Topics eliciting strongest engagement, 
    Is there a connection between mood and the original topic?
    
    # Potential approaches: 
    
    Building a model to explore a specific area, 
    building a visualisation tool,
    designing infographics. 
    
    # For those who are less technical : 
    
    Content analysis, topic analysis etc

<br><br>

### DWP Strand:  
Investigating vacancies for jobs on social media

<br><br>
           
           
    # Aim:
           
    Gain insight into the types of jobs advertised and compare to existing 
    official statistics
    
    # Example areas for investigation: 
    
    Types of jobs, 
    Amounts, 
    Where advertised and through whom,
    Skills etc
           
    # Potential approaches: 
           
    Visualisation tool for jobcentre staff to be able to visualise types 
    and areas advertised,
    Spatial analysis, Natural Language Processing. 
           
    # For those who are less technical: 
           
    Comparisons to existing data sources, 
    research into prevalence of jobs being advertised on social media.
    Can apply directly or are they re-directed to job site?

<br><br>

### MoJ Strand: 
Reported experience of the employment justice system.

<br><br>

    # Aim: 
    
    Understand how people resolve justice problems using social media. 
    This could provide additional insights to existing evidence base.
    
    # Example areas for investigation: 
    
    Types of justice problems discussed, 
    Myths and misconceptions that could be clarified,
    What sources people seek advice from, 
    Problem resolution, 
    Motivations e.g. financial, principle
    
    # Potential approaches: 
    
    Machine learning, spatial analysis, 
    Natural Language Processing, 
    Visualisation. 
    
    # For those who are less technical: 
    
    Design user journeys, research existing evidence of social media use
    to resolve problems, 
    comparison to existing data sources

### Useful Data Science cheatsheets

We got you covered:

<br><br>

### Careful with sharing!!!

We want to promote the exploration of social media research within government across the professions, however we ask that you treat these topics with the same discretion as you would if they were being researched within your own department. Thus please do not tweet about findings or share your findings externally. Please be careful when using visualisation tools that may share data/ analysis in an open way.
